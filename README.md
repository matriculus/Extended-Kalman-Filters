# Extended Kalman Filter

This project involves a Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

The program communicates with the simulator through uWebSocketIO.

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Basic Simulating Instructions

1. Run the simulator app and select the 1/2 EKF project.
2. Use "Restart" to refresh the program.
3. Open "Terminal" app.
4. Clone this repo.
5. Run `$ bash build_and_run.sh` in the terminal to build and run the algorithm.

## Other Important Dependencies
